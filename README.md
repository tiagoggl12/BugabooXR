# ARCore Unity App

Unity 6 AR application with ARCore and ARKit support for cross-platform mobile AR experiences.

## Overview

This project uses Unity's AR Foundation framework to create augmented reality experiences that work on both Android (ARCore) and iOS (ARKit) devices. It includes an interactive onboarding flow, object placement, manipulation, and plane detection visualization.

## Features

- **Cross-platform AR**: Support for both ARCore (Android) and ARKit (iOS)
- **Interactive Onboarding**: Progressive tutorial system to guide users through AR setup
- **Object Placement**: Tap to place 3D objects on detected surfaces
- **Object Manipulation**: Move, scale, and rotate placed objects using touch gestures
- **Plane Visualization**: Toggle visualization of detected AR planes with fade effects
- **Debug Menu**: Built-in debugging tools for AR development

## Requirements

### Development
- Unity 6000.3.3f1 or later
- JetBrains Rider or Visual Studio (recommended)
- macOS for iOS builds

### Runtime
- **Android**: ARCore-compatible device (Android 7.0+)
